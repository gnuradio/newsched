# Newsched

In order to get more developers involved in the newsched project, which is aimed to be the GR 4.0 runtime and a sandbox to work out new ideas related revamping GNU Radio for enhanced modularity and native support of heterogenous and distributed platforms, we present a tutorial of the components of newsched.

## What is newsched

Newsched is the attempt to create an SDR framework that is simple, yet flexible, and pleasant to develop applications with.  Much is leveraged / copied from GNU Radio, but we are not attempting to keep GNU Radio entirely intact either.
