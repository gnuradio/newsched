- cpp-httplib (as subproject)
- cppzmq (as subproject)
- CUSP (optional, if cuda_enabled == true)
- PMTF (subproject, use latest)
  
### Project-wide
- Use CLI11 instead of boost program_options
- Use meson wraps instead of git submodules
- Update to latest PMT API (::pmt insted of ::wrap)
- Remove d_itemsize parameter from untyped blocks, using buffer itemsize instead in work() calculation

- make CUSP and optional subproject
- rename `dims` to `shape` for .yml ports
- move blocks from `blocks` to `streamops` per GREP 0020
- use `size_t` where preferable (such as `block_work_io`) 

### Kernel Lib:
- Takes on separable methods from blocklib modules
- currently math (from gr::runtime), filter, fft, digital
- dependency on gr namespace remains for prefs/logging
- filter: pfb_arb_resampler - use single template (de-duplication)

### analog
- sig_source - with top level enums
- noise_source - with top level enums
- quadrature demod block

### audio
- added module with single `alsa_sink` block
  - top level sink / src blocks will be hier blocks 
  - need separate block implementations for .yml to work properly

### blocks
- msg_forward block and associated benchmark test
- make message ports on msg_debug block optional


### fft
- replace boost::file_lock with custom (copied) implementation

### fileio
- allow size deduction for src, sink blocks

### filter
- fir_filter block

- port size deduction on zmq blocks

### gr
- Renamed from "runtime" --> "gr"
- Separated out runtime from flowgraph - runtime takes in a flowgraph
- Default runtime if none specified
- Inside block, use neighbor_interface pointer instead of scheduler to keep more general
- convenience functions in block.cc to notify scheduler to do work
- rtmon: update the flushing logic
- concurrent_queue: use, then remove moodycamel lock-free implementation - still there but #if'd out
- random string generator in node_id_generator
- block parameters use PMT directly instead of parameter class
- make autogenerated blocks store the module 
- Use INHERITED_CONSTRUCTORS macro in blockname_gen.cc
- autogenerated blocks have suffix() method
- serialization and deserialization of block parameters, and all parameters in a block
- zmq based custom buffers
- allow default scheduler in multi-sched flowgraphs 
- add "system" message port
- make scheduler flow wait for start signal to hold messages pending at port
- rename runtime components {monitor, proxy} from flowgraph to runtime_
- blocks with default json serialization
- refactor port code to have separate interface in port_interface.h
- allow connection of phantom nodes: In cases where the node is not connected to anything, make it
configurable to nullptrs via the graph::connect routine
- serialization of message port messages
- many additional python bindings
- alias top_block to flowgraph for easy porting of qa and other scripts
- RPC interface support
- Example distributed runtime
- check thread state before joining - avoid stopping stopped thread and causing hangup
- port in the update GR 3.x logging framework
- mechanism for default preferences
- remove gpdict class, use map instead
- remove viter typedefs
- copy boost this_line_location functionality internally to remove boost dep
- tags: use struct with offset/map
- tags: serialization support
- module level enums described in yml
- "come back later" method on block.h to ping the scheduler after some time
- use `yml` instead of `.conf` for preferences
- use predicate for parameter setting callback
- fix python gil locking and qa
- alias numpy blocks as block and sync_block
- clean up public headers
- hier_block: basic functionality
- allow ctrl-c from python flowgraphs
- de-duplicate the partitioning code - use the same method for RPC and multi-scheduler
- block_work_io: convenience methods for min items
- work_t as std::function
- prefs: additional convenience methods for parsing yml

### docs
- doc on creating block
- build `doc` tag from .yml into the python bindings
- update doxygen build


### blockbuilder
- use vector types for grc templates
- populate template instantiations and grc for specific type combos
- 3 way templating for blocks
- change `cmd` port to `param`
- simplified typekeys, no more suffix, use sigmf data types
- add unsigned types to lookups

### "modtool"
- add .clang-format
- update scripts with new macros and constructor args
- add copyright info to generated code
- touch `meson.build` to trigger initial code gen of block
- updates for oot usage
- rename oot output as `gr4-module` (instead of `ns-module`)
- remove unnecessary options


### grc
- bring up to date with changes in gnuradio/main
- return edge object from connect in qt gui graphs
- template: pass flowgraph into runtime
- shebang correctly / make only executable what will be executed 

## [0.2.0] - [2021.12.09]
### meson build
- Add .gitignore explicitly where autogeneration is expected rather than a global filter

### runtime
- Allow for itemsize of 0 by default to be connected to anything
  - This allows a, e.g., copy block to be connected with no templating or setting of the item size
  - Blocks will take on the itemsize of the first connected block it finds
- More generic factory interface using yaml string for scheduler
- Additional logic to flush the scheduler in the sequence of events when a block starts the `DONE` process
- Blocks now have a default `param_update` message port that using a pmtf::map can change any parameter that is exposed
- Further removal of Boost::format
- Python Block interface
  - Two methods to create python blocks
    - Through the "gateway" wrapping, arbitrarily create a python block 
    - Through the block yml with python lang implementation
      - This gives access to more inherited block features, tighter coupling
- Add default cmd message port to all blocks
- Generic factory interface using yaml string configuration
- Prefix path loading relative path to lib to give correct gr::prefix()
- Moved implementation out of block.hh

### qtgui
- Update fft and filter blocks to allow for function qtgui

### grc
- Update domain property of a port to be evaluated parameter
- Selectable domains automatically generated from block yml
  - Automatic in grc file generation to have enum of specified implementations as domains
- Supports optional tags on ports
- Port ID from the yml is rendered into the grc file
- Port in recent changes from gnuradio 

### blocks
- Fixed bug in throttle that was causing flowgraph to hang

### soapy
- Restructure the code generation to allow multiple GRC files from a single block yaml
- Generate a .grc block for RTL-SDR and HackRF

### Scheduler-NBT
- Update the logic to "kick" the scheduler when input has been blocked
  
## [0.1.1] - [2021.11.11]

Didn't take long to require a patch from the first release

### runtime
* Propagate dependencies through meson
  * not having this was causing build issues on Fedora

### blocklib
* Adds some missing include files

## [0.1.0] - [2021.11.11]

Here it is: the first release of newsched!  

Newsched is the proof of concept framework for a future GNU Radio 4.0

By releasing newsched in a slightly formal way, the hope is that more developers will 
have access to this framework and learn the concepts that will eventually
find their way into the GNU Radio codebase.  

Development on newsched has been ongoing for over a year, so the codebase
has evolved rapidly in that time - thus there are no details for this first
changelist.  Just consider this the first drop.

### Core Features
- Modular Scheduler Framework
  - interfaces based on a single input queue
  - default scheduler with N blocks/thread
- Custom Buffers
- YAML-driven Block Workflow
- Consolidated Parameter Access Mechanisms
- Simplified Block APIs

Detailed documentation can be found [here](https://gnuradio.github.io/newsched)

With this release of newsched, you can easily create your own blocks, custom
buffers, and even your own scheduler if you are so inclined

Special thanks to Bastian Bloessl and Marcus MÃ¼ller for leading the effort 
to architect the runtime and provide guidance as to the design decisions

Also want to acknowledge the Scheduler Working Group who have consulted and provided
feedback and ideas on a regular basis about design decisions.  I apologize
if I have left anyone out here, but another special thanks to: Seth Hitefield,
Jeff Long, David Sorber, Mike Piscopo, Jacob Gilbert, Marc Lichtman, Philip Balister,
Jim Kulp, Wylie Standage, Garrett Vanhoy, John Sallay, and all the people associated with 
with the DARPA DSSoC program that shared their research giving valuable insight.

There is much work left to do, so please reach out on chat.gnuradio.org #scheduler
room if you would like to get involved
